The Tuskegee Land Utilization Project which was also known as the Tuskegee Planned Land Use Demonstration, was located about two and one-half miles northeast of Tuskegee in Macon County. The original project area consisted of approximately 10,358 acres of land and was purchased by the federal government during a three-year period of 1935 to 1938.



The purchase of this land was authorized by the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, also known as the Submarginal Land Program. This program's objectives were to acquire eroded, worn-out farmland, resettle the occupants and develop the newly purchased land for other uses such as forestry, wildlife and recreation. Many other changes and actions occurred prior to the area being proclaimed a national forest.



On November 27, 1959, the area was proclaimed the Tuskegee National Forest by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Prior to federal government acquisition, the area that is now the Tuskegee National Forest was one of the most abused, eroded wastelands in Alabama. The land was 80 percent cut-over

<font face="comic sans ms" color="blue" size="4">Come join us for the Kick Off Event of the GeoFest 2014 Weekend.



We will meet at the above coordinates at 6:30 pm. It is another great time of good food, good company and good stories as we begin the GeoFest 2014 Weekend.



Once again we gather at same location as last year. Last year we had more people than anticipated even with the bad weather. The food was good but management was not quite prepared for the number of people but we will be better prepared for the crowd this year. We have met and management is taking steps to ensure it does not happen again. So come one, come all for good food and even better fellowship.</font>
